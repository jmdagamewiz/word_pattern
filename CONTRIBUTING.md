## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests WIP

If you believe something is not working as expected, or that a new feature should be added to word_pattern, feel free to
[open an issue here](https://github.com/roccobarbi/word_pattern/issues). Before opening an issue, read through the
existing open issues to check if someone already asked for what you desire. If you find either the same request, or a
very similar one, please do not open a duplicate issue, but rather comment the existing one to either show your support
or (preferably) add some new input to improve it.

### Adding or improving a dictionary WIP

The quality of the output for this program depends mostly on the quantity and quality of its dictionaries.

Adding a dictionary is a straightforward process, but it requires a few, small changes to dictionaries/dictionary.py.
A complete guide to this process will be added soon. It goes without saying that adding support for a new language is
extremely useful to this project.

Editing a dictionary is a much simpler process. You only need to find the .txt file for the desired language under
dictionaries/, and to make the necessary changes. For example, you may want to add some conjugated form that may have
been omitted, or a list of proper names.
